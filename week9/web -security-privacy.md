# Web security and privacy

## Security

- Potential Security Oversits
    - no user authentication
    - weak authentication
    - sessions dont time out

    - DDoS
    - Overwhelm a server with malicous requests to block regualr users
    - REquests dont come from one machine
    - attacker uses a number of controlled machines often compromised

- DDoS Mitigation
    - rate limiting
        - limit volume fo requests from a user
    - throw out excess traffic at random
    - distribute traffic across network

- Network Security
    - Need to send requests: GET


- Encrryption and Decryption
    - Encryption: 
        - ensures pricay within an organization and on the interjnet
    - Decryption: 
        - process of converting ----

- Browser-Server Communication
    - can use encrypted communication in a web app
        - HTTPS represents an encrypted (secure) connection
